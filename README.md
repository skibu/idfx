# Component idfx
### C++ component library for esp-idf projects.

The purpose of this library is to make it easier to use C++ to create an esp-idf project for the ESP32 microprocessor.
The prime motivation was to make it easier to manage the Modulencer project, but also to share what I learned about using esp-idf.
